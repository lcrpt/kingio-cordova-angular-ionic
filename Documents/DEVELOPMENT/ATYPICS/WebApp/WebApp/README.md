# Atypics

# How to run the application :

Run this URL (there is a link to the Node Server) : http://delassen.etudiant-eemi.com/Projet/Test/   

Or you can directly run this URL to go straight to the App located Server : http://atypics-56449.onmodulus.net/

# Access to the Admin space
We had created a login rules for EEMI to access to the admin space :

1) Click on the header Btn SignIn

2) login email : projet3adw@eemi.com 

3) login password : 3Aeemi2015

4) and then submit, you will arrive on the timeline.

5) then replace /timeline by /admin, if you tried to do an action and loggedin was required you will return to the last route. So just go to this url : http://atypics-56449.onmodulus.net/admin

6) You arrive on the Admin Space you can add new posts, tags and then please remove them.



# Waiting for file change and config :
- There is a bug when you will try to submit et Post because i didn't configure the Collection File Systeme on this server. 
  It will be modify to uplaod on Amazone Cloud Service.
- Facebook login is cofigure to redirect on localhost:3000 for testing but it's working perfectly in local.









# Documentation :

client :
Any directory named client is not loaded on the server. Similar to wrapping your code in if (Meteor.isClient) { ... }. All files loaded on the client are automatically concatenated and minified when in production mode. In development mode, JavaScript and CSS files are not minified, to make debugging easier. (CSS files are still combined into a single file for consistency between production and development, because changing the CSS file's URL affects how URLs in it are processed.)
    
HTML files in a Meteor application are treated quite a bit differently from a server-side framework. Meteor scans all the HTML files in your directory for three top-level elements: <head>, <body>, and <template>. The head and body sections are separately concatenated into a single head and body, which are transmitted to the client on initial page load.
    
server :

Any directory named server is not loaded on the client. Similar to wrapping your code in if (Meteor.isServer) { ... }, except the client never even receives the code. Any sensitive code that you don't want served to the client, such as code containing passwords or authentication mechanisms, should be kept in the server directory.

Meteor gathers all your JavaScript files, excluding anything under the client, public, and private subdirectories, and loads them into a Node.js server instance. In Meteor, your server code runs in a single thread per request, not in the asynchronous callback style typical of Node. We find the linear execution model a better fit for the typical server code in a Meteor application.

public :

All files inside a top-level directory called public are served as-is to the client. When referencing these assets, do not include public/ in the URL, write the URL as if they were all in the top level. For example, reference public/bg.png as <img src='/bg.png' />. This is the best place for favicon.ico, robots.txt, and similar files.

private :

All files inside a top-level directory called private are only accessible from server code and can be loaded via the Assets API. This can be used for private data files and any files that are in your project directory that you don't want to be accessible from the outside.

client/compatibility :

This folder is for compatibility JavaScript libraries that rely on variables declared with var at the top level being exported as globals. Files in this directory are executed without being wrapped in a new variable scope. These files are executed before other client-side JavaScript files.
